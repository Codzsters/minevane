        <h2>Starter Challenge</h2>
        To gain entry to our main world, you must first complete a challenge at the new player area! 

        The point of this challenge is to dissuade griefers and troublemakers from our server and keep our community protected!<br /> You will need to follow the steps below in order to obtain access to general permissions such as <span style="color:#FFFF55">/warp spawn</span> and <span style="color:#FFFF55">/sethome</span>
        <br />
        To gain access to our community, you must follow the book that is provided when you spawn in. This tells you everything you need to know about the challenge. Generally, you can expect the challenge to take you around 30 minutes to complete.
          Hint: Staff have a <span style="color:#FFAA00">GOLD</span> name in the tablist.
